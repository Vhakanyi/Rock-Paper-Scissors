# Rock-Paper-Scissors

Project Description

A simple JavaScript implementation of the classic Rock Paper Scissors game where you play 5 rounds against the computer.

Key Features

Computer randomly selects rock, paper, or scissors

Player inputs their choice via prompt

Tracks and displays scores after each round

Declares a winner after 5 rounds

Why No Loop Was Used

The game was intentionally implemented without loops to:

Make the code more explicit and easier to follow for beginners

Clearly demonstrate the sequence of 5 rounds

Avoid potential confusion with loop mechanics for those learning JavaScript

Show a straightforward approach to game state management

How to Play

Open the JavaScript file in a browser or Node.js environment

When prompted, type "rock", "paper", or "scissors"

The game will automatically play 5 rounds and declare a winner

This implementation focuses on clarity and readability over brevity.
